# The purpose of this repository is to fix the behavior of the Picture-in-picture feature for android.

When using `expo` [`video`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/video/) if one enable the `startsPictureInPictureAutomatically` property, then PiP will be used for the whole app. Eventhough the video player has been unmounted. See attached screenshot :
